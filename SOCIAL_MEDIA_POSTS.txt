💻 Tech Stack Highlights:
• Frontend: React 18+ with Vite for lightning-fast development
• Styling: Tailwind CSS 4.0 for rapid UI development
• Backend: Firebase Authentication + Cloud Firestore
• AI Integration: Google Gemini AI for personalized travel recommendations
• APIs: OpenWeatherMap for real-time weather, Leaflet for interactive maps
• Deployment: Netlify with continuous deployment

🎯 Key Features Implemented:
✅ AI-Powered Travel Assistant - Personalized itinerary generation
✅ Interactive Attractions Database - 50+ Cape Town attractions with maps
✅ Smart Itinerary Planner - Multi-day trip planning with PDF export
✅ Booking System - Hotel and restaurant reservations with Firestore
✅ User Authentication - Secure Firebase auth with protected routes
✅ Weather Integration - Real-time data with activity recommendations
✅ Responsive Design - Mobile-first approach, works on all devices

[📸 INSERT FIGURE 2: Collage showing 4 key features:

 - Screenshot of Interactive map with attraction markers
 - Screenshot of Itinerary Planner with activities
 - Screenshot of Weather Widget with activity suggestions]

🔐 Security First:
Implemented comprehensive Firestore security rules ensuring:
• User-specific data isolation
• Authenticated read/write operations
• Environment variable protection for API keys

📊 Project Stats:
• Development Time: 8 hours (8 AM - 4 PM)
• Lines of Code: 10,000+
• Components: 30+ React components
• Pages: 15+ fully functional pages
• API Integrations: 4 major services

[📸 INSERT FIGURE 3: Infographic or table showing project statistics with icons]

🎓 Key Learnings:
1. Modern tools like Vite and Tailwind dramatically accelerate development
2. Firebase provides a production-ready backend with minimal setup
3. AI integration (Gemini) can be implemented surprisingly quickly
4. Component-based architecture enables rapid feature development
5. Good planning and clear architecture are crucial for speed

💡 Technical Highlights:
• Context API for global state management
• Service layer pattern for API abstractions
• Fallback strategies (Firestore → localStorage)
• Real-time authentication state management
• Client-side query optimization for Firestore
